# The-Shoppies

* Created a responsive webpage as part of my task for Shopifyâ€™s job application process for the position of frontend developer. 
* Connected to the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to set up a search bar for users to browse through their favourite movies and select their favourite ones and add them to their nominations.
* Also allowed for their nominations to be downloaded as a CSV file so that it can be shared or viewed at a later time.
